# Proposed Enhancements

This document lists enhancements that have been proposed but not yet implemented in the codebase.

## Configuration Enhancements

### vite.config.js

The current vite.config.js file has basic proxy configuration:

```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': 'http://localhost:8000',
    '/token': 'http://localhost:8000',
    '/launch': 'http://localhost:8000',
    '/exports': 'http://localhost:8000',
    '/health': 'http://localhost:8000',
  }
}
```

Proposed enhancements:

```javascript
// Add path aliases for easier imports
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
  },
},

// More detailed proxy configuration with additional options
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8000',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    },
    '/token': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8000',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    },
    '/launch': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8000',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    },
  },
}
```

### tailwind.config.js

The current tailwind.config.js file is correctly configured. No specific enhancements are proposed at this time.

### postcss.config.js

The current postcss.config.js file is correctly configured. No specific enhancements are proposed at this time.

## Component Enhancements

### ModelViewer.jsx

The current ModelViewer.jsx component is comprehensive and well-implemented. Proposed enhancements:

- Add support for model annotations
- Implement model comparison feature
- Add export options for different 3D file formats
- Implement measurement tools for precise model dimensions

### VideoUpload.jsx

The current VideoUpload.jsx component is well-implemented. Proposed enhancements:

- Add support for batch uploads
- Implement video trimming directly in the browser
- Add progress indicators for the processing stage after upload
- Implement automatic quality detection and suggestions

### App.jsx

The current App.jsx component is comprehensive and well-implemented. Proposed enhancements:

- Implement a more robust error boundary system
- Add user preference persistence
- Enhance the mobile experience with dedicated mobile layouts
- Implement a guided tour for first-time users

## Feature Enhancements

### Error Logging

Proposed enhancements:

- Implement structured logging with severity levels
- Add user context to error logs
- Implement log rotation and archiving
- Add a debug console accessible to administrators

### Performance Monitoring

Proposed enhancements:

- Implement real-time performance metrics dashboard
- Add resource usage monitoring
- Implement automatic performance regression detection
- Add user-perceived performance metrics

### Accessibility

Proposed enhancements:

- Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation
- Add screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- Implement high contrast mode
- Add font size adjustment controls

### Internationalization

Proposed enhancements:

- Add support for right-to-left languages
- Implement language detection based on user preferences
- Add region-specific formatting for dates, times, and numbers
- Implement a translation management system

## Implementation Plan

These enhancements should be prioritized based on:

1. User impact
2. Implementation complexity
3. Dependencies on other enhancements

A suggested implementation order:

1. Configuration enhancements (vite.config.js)
2. Error logging enhancements
3. Accessibility enhancements
4. Component enhancements (ModelViewer.jsx, VideoUpload.jsx)
5. Performance monitoring enhancements
6. Internationalization enhancements

Each enhancement should be implemented as a separate feature branch and thoroughly tested before merging into the main codebase.
