Start implementing these improvements systematically, beginning with the most critical areas

explain every, each and all chain of thought reasoning steps

then

explain every, each and all chain of thought reasoning steps as a python script

continue with style, upgrading without removing features or breaking code

I'll start with the most critical improvements while maintaining existing functionality. Let's begin with a systematic approach focusing on security, reliability, and code organization first.

Chain of Thought - Implementation Strategy:

First, we'll create a proper project structure and configuration management
This is critical as it affects all other improvements
Makes the codebase maintainable and scalable
Enables proper testing and deployment
Then implement proper security measures
Current subprocess calls are a security risk
Input validation is minimal
No authentication/authorization
Follow with error handling and logging improvements
Current error handling is basic
Logging needs structured format
Need proper traceability
Let me start by creating a proper project structure:
