review code base, explain and assist user with creating a mission critical, production ready tool

I'll help you review the codebase and assist with creating a production-ready tool. Let me first examine the project structure.

Analyzed
~/Documents/scripts/AI/swipswaps/skydiveu/parachute_anim
I see this appears to be a Python project related to parachute animation, possibly part of a larger skydiving simulation system. Let me examine some key files to understand the core functionality.

First, let's look at the core module since it appears to be the largest and likely contains the main functionality:

Analyzed

core.py
Let me check the API module as well to understand how this system is exposed:

Analyzed

api.py
Based on my analysis, I understand this is a production system for generating 3D models from parachute videos using photogrammetry. Let me explain the current system and suggest improvements to make it more production-ready:

Current System Overview:

The system processes parachute videos to create 3D models using photogrammetry
Core components:
Video segment download and frame extraction
3D model generation using Meshroom
REST API interface using FastAPI
Audit logging system
To make this system production-ready, here are the critical areas we should address:

Error Handling & Validation
Current error handling is basic
No input validation for video URLs or time formats
No disk space checks before operations
Security
System uses sudo commands without proper controls
Direct file operations without sanitization
No API authentication/authorization
Monitoring & Observability
Basic logging but no structured metrics
No health checks or system status monitoring
No performance tracking
Scalability & Resource Management
No concurrent job handling
No resource limits on disk usage or CPU
No job queuing system
Data Management
No cleanup of temporary files
No data retention policy
No backup strategy
Would you like me to help implement improvements in any of these areas? I can:

Add robust error handling and validation
Implement secure authentication and authorization
Add monitoring and observability
Implement job queuing and resource management
Set up proper data lifecycle management
Which area would you like to tackle first?
